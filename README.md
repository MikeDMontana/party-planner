# Party Planner v1
## A Foodie Party Planning Tool

An app that democratizes foodie party planning by allowing users to search, save, and vote on recipes.  Users create a party (such as Christmas), then create meals (i.e. *Dinner*), then search and save recipes to their party board.  Other members of the party upvote or downvote the recipe.  When the majority of the party committee downvotes the recipe is automatically removed from the board, leaving the party with recipes that all users are excited for and agree on.
